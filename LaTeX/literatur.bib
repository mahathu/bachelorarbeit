  abstract = {Extracting patient data documented in text-based clinical records into a structured form is a predominantly manual process, both time and cost-intensive. Moreover, structured patient records often fail to effectively capture the nuances of patient-specific observations noted in doctors' unstructured clinical notes and diagnostic reports. Automated techniques that utilize such unstructured text reports for modeling useful clinical information for supporting predictive analytics applications can thus be highly beneficial. In this paper, we propose a neural network based method for predicting mortality risk of ICU patients using unstructured Electrocardiogram (ECG) text reports. Word2Vec word embedding models were adopted for vectorizing and modeling textual features extracted from the patients' reports. An unsupervised data cleansing technique for identification and removal of anomalous data/special cases was designed for optimizing the patient data representation. Further, a neural network model based on Extreme Learning Machine architecture was proposed for mortality prediction. ECG text reports available in the MIMIC-III dataset were used for experimental validation. The proposed model when benchmarked against four standard ICU severity scoring methods, outperformed all by 10\textendash 13\%, in terms of prediction accuracy.},
