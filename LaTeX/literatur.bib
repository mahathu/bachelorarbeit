  abstract = {Rooted in statistical learning or Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, support vector machines (SVMs) are well positioned to generalize on yet-to-be-seen data. The SVM concepts presented in Chapter 3can be generalized to become applicable to regression problems. As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik's -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, it has excellent generalization capability, with high prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {Background We created a family of prognostic models for Ebola virus disease from the largest dataset of EVD patients published to date. We incorporated these models into an app, ``Ebola Care Guidelines'', that provides access to recommended, evidence-based supportive care guidelines and highlights the signs/symptoms with the largest contribution to prognosis.Methods We applied multivariate logistic regression on 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Sierra Leone during the 2014-16 outbreak. We validated the models with two independent datasets from Sierra Leone.Findings Viral load and age were the most important predictors of death. We generated a parsimonious model including viral load, age, body temperature, bleeding, jaundice, dyspnea, dysphagia, and referral time recorded at triage. We also constructed fallback models for when variables in the parsimonious model are unavailable. The performance of the parsimonious model approached the predictive power of observational wellness assessments by experienced health workers, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 and overall accuracy of 64\% to 74\%.Interpretation Machine-learning models and mHealth tools have the potential for improving the standard of care in low-resource settings and emergency scenarios, but data incompleteness and lack of generalizable models are major obstacles. We showed how harmonization of multiple datasets yields prognostic models that can be validated across different cohorts. Similar performance between the parsimonious model and those incorporating expert wellness assessments suggests that clinically-guided machine learning approaches can recapitulate clinical expertise, and thus be useful when such expertise is unavailable. We also demonstrated with our guidelines app how integration of those models with mobile technologies enables deployable clinical management support tools that facilitate access to comprehensive bodies of medical knowledge.Funding Howard Hughes Medical Institute, US National Institutes of Health},

  abstract = {Extracting patient data documented in text-based clinical records into a structured form is a predominantly manual process, both time and cost-intensive. Moreover, structured patient records often fail to effectively capture the nuances of patient-specific observations noted in doctors' unstructured clinical notes and diagnostic reports. Automated techniques that utilize such unstructured text reports for modeling useful clinical information for supporting predictive analytics applications can thus be highly beneficial. In this paper, we propose a neural network based method for predicting mortality risk of ICU patients using unstructured Electrocardiogram (ECG) text reports. Word2Vec word embedding models were adopted for vectorizing and modeling textual features extracted from the patients' reports. An unsupervised data cleansing technique for identification and removal of anomalous data/special cases was designed for optimizing the patient data representation. Further, a neural network model based on Extreme Learning Machine architecture was proposed for mortality prediction. ECG text reports available in the MIMIC-III dataset were used for experimental validation. The proposed model when benchmarked against four standard ICU severity scoring methods, outperformed all by 10\textendash 13\%, in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the~lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.},
